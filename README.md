The process is:

make a ~/home subdir - I use to name it Applications where you will download all the appimages

Download appimagelauncher as appimage

Make it executable

Run it from the terminal with the parameter install

After this install, when you run the first time an appimage it shows up in menu and from there you can add it to the panel by the right click menu

Depending from how the appimage has been packaged, from the menu you can also update the ones that allow update (right click menu on the appomage name).
